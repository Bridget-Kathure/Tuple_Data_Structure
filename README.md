# Tuple_Data_Structure

A tuple is a in-built data structure that contains ordered collection of elements which are immutable.

TUPLE PROPERTIES
1. They are immutable.
2. Hold different data types.
3. You can access elements using indexing.

ADVANTAGES OF TUPLES
1. Provide data integrity because they are immutable.
2. Faster,simple in structure and take up less space.
3. Can be used as keys in dictionaries.
4. Returns multiple values from a function.

DISADVANTAGES OF TUPLES
1. Lacks flexibility.
2. They are not versatile.
3. They are less intuitive because accessing elements is by index.

APPLICATIONS OF TUPLES
1. Returning multiple values from a function.
2. Storing related but different types of data together.
3. Creating keys in dictionaries.# Tuple_Data_Structure
